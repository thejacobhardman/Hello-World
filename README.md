# Hello-World
Learning the basics of Git

Greetings Programs.

My name is Jacob and I am a software engineering student in Colorado. I working on finishing my degree in the hopes of working as a developer at a tech company in the future.

I enjoy learning about software development, AI programming, web development, app development and game development.

I am learning more about how to use Git so that I can be more organized in my future projects.

Thanks for dropping by!
